/**
 * This interface denotes the components those multiply their child components to display multiple entries of an
 * associated data collection. The way of specifying collection is component-specific and is not defined by this
 * interface.
 * <p/>
 * This interface defines a notion of current object Id with its <code>objectId</code> attribute. The semantics of
 * handling the current object is specific to each particular component, and it is typically used to refer to a data
 * entry currently being rendered, or an entry that generated the server action that is being processed.
 * <p/>
 * This interface extends the NamingContainer interface because all components that are rendered multiple times are
 * expected to have a compound ID based on ID of the main component (a component implementing this interface). E.g. if
 * there's a multiplied component with id "myOutputText" in a UIObjectIterator component with a client id of
 * "myIterator1", child component's client id should be formatted as follows: "myIterator1:objectId:myOutputText".
