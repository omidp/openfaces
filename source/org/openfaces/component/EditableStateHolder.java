/**
 * This interface allows components with an "editable state" to handle their state properly inside of iteration components
 * such <o:dataTable> or <o:forEach>. The "editable state" components in this case are components that are not UIInput
 * components by themselves but that have some of their properties editable form the client-side UI. To achieve this,
 * the getSubmittedValue/setSubmittedValue methods of this interface must be implemented and all of the editable state should
 * be saved inside of the value object managed by these methods.
 * <p>
 * Note: this interface has to extend the EditableValueHolder interface to ensure its functionality since the standard
 * UIData iterators (such as the DataTable component) ensure proper editable state handling only for this interface. So
 * since only the "submittedValue" property from EditableValueHolder is used by implementations of interface, all other functions
 * have to be implemented but they don't carry any functionality and are not expected to be used.
