     * @param context     instnace of {@link javax.faces.context.FacesContext}
     * @param component   parent component for which inner controls should be rendered
     * @param portionName actually a server-side id for the inner component to be rendered. In further, there
     *                    may be an extension for this method to support not only inner components rendering, but data
     *                    retrieval too. Or maybe other method will be declared.
     * @param jsonParam   the JSON object that is passed as a parameter to O$.requestComponentPortions on the client-side,
     *                    or null if no parameter was passed.
     * @throws IOException   propagates any IO exceptions that might occur inside of this method
     * @throws JSONException in case of any JSON manipulation failure. It is declared as a checked exception here just
     *                       to free the implementations of this method from having to catch them. Invoker of this method
     *                       will just rethrow this exception as RuntimeException.
